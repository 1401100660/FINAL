## 2016 I met a fella named 'Jae' and he had a small xbox clan with his cousin. I had to choose my username and long story short I chose crucialphy. Now, phy and phi (or the golden ratio) is pretty close together.

## There is just so much weird concidences. I know that there are no ghosts, gods, or destiny but any feeling of divinity and destiny make me feel... motivated.

## perhaps that motivation is what leds people to continue their path.
